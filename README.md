I am a PhD Candidate in CS at UW-Madison.

I am part of the Wision Lab where I am advised by Prof. Mohit Gupta. My research revolves around the areas of Computer Vision, Generative AI, and 3D Sensing. Currently, I am working on 3D inference models under adverse conditions like low light, motion, and LiDAR noise.
